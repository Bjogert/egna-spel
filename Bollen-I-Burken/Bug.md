# 🐛 Bug Report: Bollen i Burken - Player Movement System Broken

**KISS**
Build slow and keep it as simple as possible. 
No unnessesray fluff and functions. always ceep scalability in mind.

## Problem Description
WASD player movement controls are completely non-functional. Player cube does not respond to any keyboard input.

## Current Issue

### 🎮 Player Movement System Failure

#### WASD Controls Not Working
**Problem**: Player cube does not move when pressing W, A, S, D keys
**Location**: ECS component system - likely disconnect between InputSystem and MovementSystem
**Issue**: Debug investigation shows potential component chain break between keyboard input detection and player entity movement processing
**Symptoms**: 
- Player cube visible and rendered correctly
- Arena and camera working properly
- No response to WASD key presses
- No movement or position updates on player entity

## Technical Investigation Findings

### ECS Component Chain Analysis
- **InputSystem**: Should detect WASD keypresses and map to movement actions (forward/backward/left/right)
- **PlayerInput Component**: Should receive mapped actions from InputSystem 
- **MovementSystem**: Should process entities with Transform + Movement + PlayerInput components
- **Player Entity**: Should have all three components attached during creation

### Potential Break Points
1. **Keyboard Event Detection**: Keys may not be triggering event handlers
2. **Key Mapping**: KeyW/KeyA/KeyS/KeyD may not be mapping to forward/backward/left/right actions
3. **Component Assignment**: Player entity may be missing one of the required components
4. **System Update Chain**: InputSystem → MovementSystem update sequence may be broken
5. **Game Loop**: Systems may not be getting called in the main game loop

### Debug Evidence
- Added console logging to track component processing
- MovementSystem expects entities with Transform + Movement + PlayerInput
- InputSystem tries to update PlayerInput component on local player
- Player creation adds Movement(0.1) and PlayerInput() components
- System registration appears correct in index.html

## Expected Behavior
- Press W key → player cube moves forward (negative Z direction)
- Press S key → player cube moves backward (positive Z direction)  
- Press A key → player cube moves left (negative X direction)
- Press D key → player cube moves right (positive X direction)
- Movement should be smooth and consistent at configured speed

## Current Behavior
- Press any WASD key → no movement occurs
- Player cube remains stationary at spawn position
- No console errors or obvious system failures
- All other systems (rendering, camera, arena) work correctly

## Files That Need Investigation
1. `js/controls.js` - InputSystem keyboard event handling and key mapping
2. `js/player.js` - MovementSystem component processing and updatePlayerMovement logic  
3. `js/game.js` - Player entity creation and component assignment
4. `index.html` - System initialization and game loop update sequence

## Priority Investigation Steps
1. **Verify keyboard events** - Check if keydown/keyup events are firing in browser console
2. **Check key mapping** - Confirm KeyW maps to 'forward' action in InputSystem
3. **Validate components** - Ensure local player has Transform, Movement, and PlayerInput components
4. **Trace system updates** - Verify InputSystem and MovementSystem are being called each frame
5. **Debug component values** - Check if PlayerInput.keys are being set correctly from keyboard input

## Test After Fix
1. Press W key - player cube should move forward
2. Press A key - player cube should move left  
3. Press S key - player cube should move backward
4. Press D key - player cube should move right
5. Movement should be smooth and bounded by arena walls
6. Debug console should show system processing and input detection
