# 🐛 Bug Report: Bollen i Burken - Player Movement System Broken

**KISS**
Build slow and keep it as simple as possible. 

## 🤖 Information for Claude Code AI Assistant

### Project Architecture Overview
**Game Type**: 3D WebGL game using Three.js with Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture
**Core Technologies**: 
- Three.js (WebGL 3D rendering)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+ classes)
- ECS pattern for game entities
- Map-based entity storage system

### Key System Components
1. **InputSystem** (`js/controls.js`) - Keyboard event handling and input mapping
2. **MovementSystem** (`js/player.js`) - Entity movement processing and physics
3. **GameEngine** (`js/game.js`) - Core ECS entity/component management
4. **GameState** - Entity storage using JavaScript Map structure
5. **Component Types**: Transform (position/velocity), Movement (speed), PlayerInput (keys), Renderable (mesh)

### Critical Technical Context
- **Entity Storage**: `gameState.entities` is a JavaScript Map, NOT an array
- **Component Access**: Use `entity.getComponent('ComponentName')` or `entity.getComponent(ComponentClass)`
- **Map Iteration**: MUST use `gameState.entities.values()` or proper Map iteration methods
- **Component Naming**: Some components may have `constructor.name === 'Object'` due to build/minification

### Common Pitfalls for AI Assistants
1. **Map vs Array Confusion**: `gameState.entities.forEach()` passes `[key, value]` pairs, not values
2. **Component Reference Issues**: Creating new velocity objects instead of modifying existing ones breaks AI/player interaction
3. **Component Naming Collisions**: Multiple components with same constructor.name overwrite each other
4. **Scope Issues**: Variables declared in try-catch blocks may not be accessible outside

### Debugging Best Practices
- Always verify component existence before accessing properties
- Use `for (const entity of gameState.entities.values())` for entity iteration
- Check `entity.components.keys()` to see actual stored component names
- Add comprehensive logging at each step of ECS processing chain
- Test both player input and AI movement systems together (they share velocity objects)

## Problem Description
WASD player movement controls are completely non-functional. Player cube does not respond to any keyboard input.

## Current Issue

### 🎮 Player Movement System Failure

#### WASD Controls Not Working
**Problem**: Player cube does not move when pressing W, A, S, D keys
**Location**: ECS component system - likely disconnect between InputSystem and MovementSystem
**Issue**: Debug investigation shows potential component chain break between keyboard input detection and player entity movement processing
**Symptoms**: 
- Player cube visible and rendered correctly
- Arena and camera working properly
- No response to WASD key presses
- No movement or position updates on player entity

## Technical Investigation Findings

### ECS Component Chain Analysis
- **InputSystem**: Should detect WASD keypresses and map to movement actions (forward/backward/left/right)
- **PlayerInput Component**: Should receive mapped actions from InputSystem 
- **MovementSystem**: Should process entities with Transform + Movement + PlayerInput components
- **Player Entity**: Should have all three components attached during creation

### Potential Break Points
1. **~~Keyboard Event Detection~~**: ✅ WORKING - Console shows key detection
2. **~~Key Mapping~~**: ✅ WORKING - Arrow keys map correctly to actions  
3. **PlayerInput Component Update**: ❓ InputSystem may not be updating PlayerInput.keys
4. **MovementSystem Processing**: ❓ May not be finding entities with required components
5. **Transform Update**: ❓ MovementSystem may not be updating Transform.position
6. **Mesh Position Sync**: ❓ Renderable may not be syncing mesh.position from Transform
7. **Component Validation**: ❌ Missing schemas causing component system issues

### Debug Evidence
- **Keyboard Detection WORKING**: Console shows "Key down: ArrowUp -> forward" - input detection is functional
- **Key Mapping WORKING**: Arrow keys correctly map to forward/backward/left/right actions
- **InputSystem WORKING**: Successfully detects and maps keyboard events
- **System Registration WORKING**: All systems (InputSystem, MovementSystem) are properly added to game engine
- **Player Creation WORKING**: Local player entity created with ID "player_cqm758brv"
- **Component Warnings**: Missing validation schemas for PlayerController, PlayerInput, Renderable components
- **CRITICAL ISSUE**: Keys detected but player cube does NOT move - break in ECS processing chain

### Console Error Analysis
```
✅ Key events detected: "Key down: ArrowUp -> forward"
✅ Systems initialized: InputSystem, MovementSystem added to engine
✅ Player created: "Added local player: player_cqm758brv"
❌ No movement visible: Player cube remains stationary despite key detection
❌ Component validation warnings: PlayerInput, PlayerController, Renderable missing schemas
```

### Root Cause Analysis
**The issue is NOT keyboard detection** - keys are being detected and mapped correctly.
**The issue IS in the ECS component processing chain** between InputSystem and MovementSystem:
1. InputSystem detects keys ✅
2. InputSystem should update PlayerInput component ❓
3. MovementSystem should read PlayerInput component ❓  
4. MovementSystem should update Transform component ❓
5. Renderable should update mesh position from Transform ❓

## Expected Behavior
- Press W key → player cube moves forward (negative Z direction)
- Press S key → player cube moves backward (positive Z direction)  
- Press A key → player cube moves left (negative X direction)
- Press D key → player cube moves right (positive X direction)
- Movement should be smooth and consistent at configured speed

## Current Behavior
- Press any WASD key → no movement occurs
- Player cube remains stationary at spawn position
- No console errors or obvious system failures
- All other systems (rendering, camera, arena) work correctly

## Files That Need Investigation
1. `js/controls.js` - InputSystem keyboard event handling and key mapping
2. `js/player.js` - MovementSystem component processing and updatePlayerMovement logic  
3. `js/game.js` - Player entity creation and component assignment
4. `index.html` - System initialization and game loop update sequence

### 🔧 Key Classes and Methods for AI Reference
```javascript
// Core ECS Classes
class Entity {
    addComponent(component)           // Stores by component.constructor.name
    getComponent(componentType)       // Gets by string name or class
    hasComponent(componentType)       // Checks component existence
}

class Transform {
    position: {x, y, z}              // Entity world position
    velocity: {x, y, z}              // Movement velocity vector
    rotation: {y}                    // Entity rotation
}

class Movement {
    speed: number                    // Movement speed multiplier
    maxSpeed: number                 // Maximum allowed speed
}

class PlayerInput {
    keys: {forward, backward, left, right}  // Input state booleans
    hasInput()                             // Returns true if any key pressed
}

// Critical System Methods
MovementSystem.update(gameState)          // Processes all moving entities
InputSystem.updatePlayerInput()           // Updates PlayerInput component
GameEngine.addSystem(system)              // Registers system for updates
```

### 🐛 Bug Pattern Recognition for AI
**Pattern 1: Map Iteration Issues**
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - forEach on Map passes [key, value] pairs
gameState.entities.forEach(entity => entity.getComponent(...))

// ✅ CORRECT - Use values() to get actual entities  
for (const entity of gameState.entities.values()) {
    entity.getComponent(...)
}
```

**Pattern 2: Object Reference Issues**
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Creates new object, discards changes
transform.velocity = Utils.vector3()

// ✅ CORRECT - Modifies existing object
transform.velocity.x = 0
transform.velocity.y = 0  
transform.velocity.z = 0
```

**Pattern 3: Component Naming Issues**
```javascript
// ❌ PROBLEM - Multiple components with same constructor.name
component.constructor.name === 'Object'  // Both Transform and Movement

// ✅ SOLUTION - Detect by properties
if (component.position && component.velocity) return 'Transform'
if (component.speed !== undefined) return 'Movement'
```

## Changes Attempted (September 21, 2025)

### ❌ Failed Attempt #1: InputSystem.update() Fix
**Change**: Modified `InputSystem.update()` to call `updatePlayerInput()` every frame instead of only on pending input
**File**: `js/controls.js`
**Result**: ❌ FAILED - Movement still broken
**Issue**: This change may have caused other problems by forcing constant input updates

### ❌ Failed Attempt #2: MovementSystem Debug Logging
**Change**: Added extensive debug logging to `MovementSystem.update()` to trace entity processing
**File**: `js/player.js`
**Result**: ❌ FAILED - Movement still broken
**Findings**: Revealed that `MovementSystem.update()` was receiving `undefined entities`

### ✅ Success #3: Map Iteration Fix
**Change**: Changed `gameState.entities.forEach(entity => {})` to `for (const entity of gameState.entities.values())`
**File**: `js/player.js` 
**Reasoning**: `gameState.entities` is a Map, not array, so `forEach()` was passing `[key,value]` pairs instead of just values
**Result**: ✅ FIXED - MovementSystem now properly iterates over entities
**Critical Finding**: `entity.getComponent()` was failing because `entity` was actually `[entityId, entityObject]` array

### ✅ Success #4: Velocity Object Reference Fix
**Change**: Changed player movement from creating new velocity objects to modifying existing ones
**File**: `js/player.js`
**Before**: `transform.velocity = Utils.vector3()` (creates new object)
**After**: `transform.velocity.x = 0; transform.velocity.y = 0; transform.velocity.z = 0;` (modifies existing)
**Reasoning**: AI system was setting `transform.velocity.x = value` but player system was discarding the object
**Result**: ✅ FIXED - Both player and AI now modify the same velocity object

### ✅ Success #5: Component Naming Collision Fix
**Change**: Fixed component storage issue where both Transform and Movement components were stored as 'Object'
**File**: `js/game.js` - `Entity.addComponent()` method
**Issue**: `component.constructor.name` was returning 'Object' for both components, causing second to overwrite first
**Fix**: Added smart detection based on component properties:
```javascript
if (componentName === 'Object') {
    if (component.position && component.velocity) {
        componentName = 'Transform';
    } else if (component.speed !== undefined && component.maxSpeed !== undefined) {
        componentName = 'Movement';
    }
}
```
**Result**: ✅ FIXED - Transform and Movement components now stored with correct names

### ✅ Success #6: Variable Scope Fix
**Change**: Fixed `movementVector` variable scope issue in movement calculation
**File**: `js/player.js`
**Issue**: Variable was declared inside try-catch block but accessed outside it, breaking movement calculation
**Result**: ✅ FIXED - Movement vector calculation now completes properly

### 🔍 Current Status: Enhanced Debugging Phase
**Action**: Added comprehensive debug logging to trace movement calculation step-by-step
**Files**: `js/player.js` - Enhanced `updatePlayerMovement()` with detailed logging
**Debug Output Expected**:
- Movement vector calculation and values
- Velocity computation and application  
- Position updates and boundary checks
- Component state verification

## Major Breakthroughs

### 🎯 Root Cause #1: Map Iteration Bug
**Discovery**: The MovementSystem was using `gameState.entities.forEach(entity => {})` but `entities` is a Map
**Problem**: `Map.forEach()` passes `(value, key, map)` parameters, so `entity` was actually `[entityId, entityObject]`
**Impact**: `entity.getComponent()` failed because it was called on an array instead of entity object
**Fix**: Changed to `for (const entity of gameState.entities.values())` to get actual entity objects

### 🎯 Root Cause #2: Velocity Object Replacement
**Discovery**: Player movement system was creating new velocity objects while AI system modified existing ones
**Problem**: 
  - AI: `transform.velocity.x = newValue` (modifies existing object)
  - Player: `transform.velocity = Utils.vector3()` (creates new object, discarding AI changes)
**Impact**: Velocity changes were being lost when objects were replaced
**Fix**: Modified player system to update existing velocity properties instead of replacing object

### 🎯 Root Cause #3: Component Naming Collision
**Discovery**: Both Transform and Movement components had `constructor.name === 'Object'`
**Problem**: Second component was overwriting first in the components Map due to identical keys
**Impact**: Player entities only had Movement component, missing Transform for position data
**Fix**: Added smart component type detection based on properties to assign correct names

## Debug Evidence Analysis

### ✅ Working Systems (Confirmed)
- **Keyboard Detection**: Console shows "Key down: ArrowUp -> forward" 
- **Key Mapping**: Arrow keys correctly map to movement actions
- **InputSystem**: Successfully detects and processes keyboard events
- **System Registration**: All systems properly added to game engine

## 🔥 CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL BUG (September 28, 2025)

### ✅ **Issue #11: ComponentValidator Method Stripping (RESOLVED)**

**🎯 ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERED**: Enterprise ComponentValidator system accidentally breaking collision detection

**The Problem**:
- **Symptom**: `TypeError: obstacleCollider.checkBoxCollision is not a function`
- **Location**: MovementSystem trying to call Collider methods
- **Infinite Loop**: Error occurs every frame (60fps) when obstacles enabled
- **Console Evidence**: 1000+ identical error messages flooding console

**🔍 Deep Analysis by Serena**:
- **Component Creation**: ✅ `new Collider()` instances created correctly with methods
- **Validation Process**: ❌ `ComponentValidator.applyAutoCorrection()` strips methods
- **Specific Issue**: Spread operator `{ ...component }` destroys prototype chain
- **Storage Result**: Plain objects stored instead of class instances
- **Runtime Failure**: MovementSystem gets methodless objects

**📍 Exact Bug Location**:
```javascript
// BEFORE (line 454 in component-validator.js):
const corrected = { ...component }; // ❌ Strips all methods!

// AFTER (FIXED):
const corrected = Object.assign(Object.create(Object.getPrototypeOf(component)), component); // ✅ Preserves methods
```

**🏗️ Architectural Issue**:
- **Enterprise Over-Engineering**: Validation system too aggressive
- **Paradigm Conflict**: Data-centric validation vs. Behavior-centric components
- **ECS Pattern Violation**: Hybrid components (data + methods) not handled properly

**✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**:
- **Immediate Fix**: Modified ComponentValidator to preserve prototype chain
- **Method Preservation**: Components retain their class methods after validation
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Existing data validation still works
- **Testing**: Obstacles + collision detection now functional

**📊 LESSONS LEARNED**:
- **Validation vs. Functionality**: Enterprise patterns can break working code
- **Method vs. Data Components**: Need clear distinction in ECS systems
- **Debugging Strategy**: Component lifecycle analysis reveals validation issues
- **Robustness**: Defensive programming needed for method-dependent components

**🎯 ARCHITECTURAL RECOMMENDATIONS**:
1. **Component Classification**: Separate data-only vs. behavior components
2. **Validation Awareness**: Skip auto-correction for functional components
3. **Method Preservation**: Always preserve prototype chain in object operations
4. **Error Prevention**: Add method existence checks in critical paths

---
*Bug report updated: September 28, 2025*
*Status: 🎉 COLLISION SYSTEM FIXED - ComponentValidator preserves methods*
*Architecture: Enterprise validation now compatible with functional components*
*Next: Step-by-step obstacle re-implementation with working collision detection*

- ✅ InputSystem detects keys correctly
- ✅ Transform and Movement components exist and accessible  
- ✅ Map iteration fixed (uses .values() not forEach)
- ✅ Velocity object references fixed (modify existing, don't replace)
- ✅ Component naming collision resolved
- 🔍 Movement calculation debugging in progress

### Next Debugging Commands
```javascript
// In browser console:
debugMovement()                    // Shows component state
testInput()                        // Shows current input state  
gameEngine.systems                 // Lists all registered systems
gameEngine.gameState.entities      // Shows entity Map
```

### If Movement Still Broken, Check:
1. **Movement Vector Calculation**: Look for "Movement vector: (x, z)" in console
2. **Velocity Application**: Check "Position update: (old) + velocity = (new)" logs  
3. **Mesh Synchronization**: Verify renderable.mesh.position updates from transform.position
4. **Boundary Checks**: Ensure arena limits aren't preventing movement
5. **Frame Rate**: Confirm game loop is calling MovementSystem.update() regularly

### AI Troubleshooting Framework
1. **Verify Input Chain**: Keys → InputSystem → PlayerInput component
2. **Verify Processing Chain**: PlayerInput → MovementSystem → Transform update
3. **Verify Render Chain**: Transform.position → Renderable.mesh.position
4. **Check Entity State**: Components exist and contain expected data
5. **Check System State**: Systems registered and updating in game loop
