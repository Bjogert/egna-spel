# Dunkgömme - Rules of the Game
## Traditional Swedish Hide-and-Seek Game

### 🎯 **Game Overview**
"Dunkgömme" (also called "Dunkgömme" or "Burken") is a classic Swedish children's game - an advanced version of hide-and-seek where players must reach a central object (the "can") to save themselves.

### 🏛️ **Game Setup**
- **Central Object**: A "can" (burken) placed in the center of the play area
- **Players**: One "Hunter/Guard" (vaktare) and one or more "Hiders" 
- **Play Area**: Large area with hiding spots (trees, buildings, obstacles)

### 🎮 **Game Rules**

#### **The Hunter's Role:**
1. **Guards the Can** - The hunter stays near the central can and protects it
2. **Seeks Hidden Players** - Searches the area for players hiding
3. **Eliminates Players** - When the hunter spots a hidden player, they must:
   - Run back to the can FIRST
   - Touch/kick the can 
   - Shout the player's name and location: "*[Player Name] behind the shed is caught, 1, 2, 3!*"
   - The spotted player is then eliminated

#### **The Players' Goal:**
1. **Hide from Hunter** - Find good hiding spots around the play area  
2. **Reach the Can** - Sneak to the central can without being spotted
3. **Save Yourself** - Touch/kick the can and shout: "*The can is kicked, 1, 2, 3!*"
4. **Win Condition** - Successfully reaching the can makes you safe and you win

#### **Key Mechanics:**
- **Race to the Can**: If a hunter spots you, it becomes a race - who reaches the can first?
  - **Hunter wins**: Player is eliminated 
  - **Player wins**: Player is safe and wins the round
- **Hunter's Dilemma**: The hunter must leave the can unguarded to search for players
- **Timing Strategy**: Players must time their approach when the hunter is far from the can

### 🎯 **Victory Conditions**

- **Hunter Wins**: All players are eliminated by being "caught" at the can

### 🎮 **Digital Implementation - Controls**
