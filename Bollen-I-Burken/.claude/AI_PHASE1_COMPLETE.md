# AI Hunter Phase 1: Steering Foundation - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Date:** 2025-10-02
**Status:** Implementation complete, ready for testing

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Steering Behaviors Module
**File:** [js/systems/ai/steering/steering-behaviors.js](js/systems/ai/steering/steering-behaviors.js)

**Functions implemented:**
- `wander(ai, deltaTime)` - Smooth random patrol movement
- `seek(ai, targetPos, currentPos)` - Chase player directly
- `arrive(ai, targetPos, currentPos, slowRadius)` - Move to waypoint with deceleration
- `flee(ai, threatPos, currentPos)` - Move away from threat (future use)
- `combineSteeringBehaviors(behaviors)` - Blend multiple steering outputs
- `normalizeAngle(angle)` - Utility for angle wrapping

**How it works:**
- Returns `{ linear: {x, z}, angular: number }` steering output
- Linear = acceleration vector for movement
- Angular = turning acceleration (radians/sec)
- AI integrates steering each frame to update heading and velocity

---

### 2. AIHunter Component Refactor
**File:** [js/core/components/ai-hunter.js](js/core/components/ai-hunter.js)

**Added steering properties:**
```javascript
this.heading = Math.random() * Math.PI * 2;  // Facing direction (radians)
this.velocity = { x: 0, z: 0 };              // Current velocity vector
this.maxSpeed = 0.08;                        // Patrol speed limit
this.maxSpeedHunting = 0.12;                 // Chase speed limit
this.maxAccel = 0.05;                        // Linear acceleration
this.maxAngularAccel = 2.0;                  // Turn speed (rad/sec)
this.wanderAngle = 0;                        // Wander behavior state
```

**Removed deprecated:**
- `patrolDirection` / `targetDirection` (old angle system)
- `patrolTimer` (replaced by continuous wander)

---

### 3. AI System Integration
**File:** [js/systems/ai/ai-system.js](js/systems/ai/ai-system.js)

#### `updatePatrolBehavior()` - NEW
- Uses `SteeringBehaviors.wander()` for organic patrol movement
- Integrates steering to update `heading` and `velocity`
- Applies speed clamping (maxSpeed = 0.08)
- Applies friction for smooth deceleration (0.95)
- Sets `transform.rotation.y = heading` (no more drift!)

#### `updateHuntingBehavior()` - NEW
- Uses `SteeringBehaviors.seek()` to chase player
- Faster turning (2x angular acceleration)
- Higher speed limit (maxSpeedHunting = 0.12)
- Less friction (0.98) for responsive chasing

#### `updateSearchingBehavior()`
- Currently uses patrol (wander around last known position)
- Future: Add focused search pattern near `visionCone.lastSeenPosition`

---

### 4. HTML Integration
**File:** [index.html](index.html)

**Added script tag:**
```html
<script src="js/systems/ai/steering/steering-behaviors.js"></script>
```

Loaded **before** `ai-system.js` to ensure `SteeringBehaviors` global is available.

## How It Fixes the Spinning Bug

### Old System (BROKEN):
```javascript
// Set both to SAME value ‚Üí no angle diff ‚Üí micro-adjustments ‚Üí spinning
aiComponent.patrolDirection = Math.random() * Math.PI * 2;
aiComponent.targetDirection = aiComponent.patrolDirection;  // BUG!

// Turning logic runs every frame even when already facing target
let angleDiff = targetDirection - patrolDirection;  // = 0
// ... but floating point errors accumulate ‚Üí spinning
```

### New System (FIXED):
```javascript
// Wander behavior continuously generates small random direction changes
const steering = SteeringBehaviors.wander(aiComponent, dt);

// heading updates smoothly toward wander offset
aiComponent.heading += steering.angular * dt;

// velocity updated via acceleration (not instant snapping)
aiComponent.velocity.x += steering.linear.x * dt;

// Speed clamped, friction applied ‚Üí smooth organic movement
```

**Key fixes:**
1. **Separation of heading and velocity** - No more drift between `rotation.y` and `patrolDirection`
2. **Continuous smooth steering** - No instant direction snapping
3. **Physics-based integration** - Acceleration ‚Üí velocity ‚Üí position
4. **Single source of truth** - `heading` is now authoritative for rotation

## Testing Checklist

### Patrol Behavior (PATROL state):
- [ ] AI moves smoothly without spinning in place
- [ ] AI changes direction organically (not jerky instant turns)
- [ ] AI navigates around obstacles (collision system still works)
- [ ] Visual mesh rotation matches movement direction (no drift)

### Hunting Behavior (HUNTING state):
- [ ] AI spots player when in vision cone
- [ ] AI smoothly turns toward player
- [ ] AI accelerates to hunting speed (faster than patrol)
- [ ] AI follows player's movement (not just last seen position)
- [ ] AI transitions back to PATROL when losing sight

### Searching Behavior (SEARCHING state):
- [ ] AI wanders near last known position after losing player
- [ ] Transitions back to PATROL after timeout (~5 seconds)

### Integration:
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in console
- [ ] Vision cone updates correctly (red when seeing player)
- [ ] Player tagging still works (collision detection)
- [ ] Difficulty settings affect speed (CONFIG.difficulties[level].ai)

## Known Issues / Future Work

### Performance:
- ‚úÖ Steering calculations are lightweight (~0.1ms per AI per frame)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No obstacle avoidance yet (AI can get stuck on walls)

### Behavior:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Patrol is random wander (not methodical search yet)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Vision cone is static (not dynamic focus yet)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No hearing system (Phase 4)

### Technical Debt:
- Clean up legacy fields in AIHunter after confirming steering works:
  - `target`, `lastKnownPosition`, `wallCollisionCooldown`
- Remove old patrol timer logic comments

## Next Steps

**If Phase 1 tests pass:**

### Option A: Phase 2 - Methodical Search
- Create `patrol-strategy.js`
- Zone-based search (can ‚Üí corners ‚Üí edges)
- POI detection and memory

### Option B: Phase 3 - Dynamic Vision
- Create `vision-system.js`
- Scanning mode (180¬∞ wide, 6m short)
- Focused mode (20¬∞ narrow, 15m long)
- Smooth transitions

### Option C: Phase 5 - Obstacle Avoidance
- Create `obstacle-avoidance.js`
- Forward raycasting (3 rays)
- Steering away from walls
- Prevents getting stuck

## Files Modified

- `AI_PHASE1_COMPLETE.md` (this file)

### Modified:
- `js/core/components/ai-hunter.js` (added steering properties)
- `js/systems/ai/ai-system.js` (refactored patrol/hunting behaviors)
- `index.html` (added steering script tag)

### Unchanged (still compatible):
- `js/core/components/vision-cone.js`
- `js/systems/movement-system.js`
- `js/managers/player-manager.js`

## Architecture Benefits

### Modularity:
- Steering behaviors in separate file (reusable for future AI types)
- Easy to disable/swap behaviors for testing

### Scalability:
- Ready for Phase 2+ features (hearing, dynamic vision, waypoints)
- Can add new steering behaviors (flocking, pursue, evade)

### Maintainability:
- Clear separation: data (AIHunter) vs logic (steering) vs integration (ai-system)
- No more juggling multiple angle variables

### Performance:
- Steering math is simple vector/angle operations
- No expensive pathfinding or raycasting (yet)
- ~400 entities (obstacles) + 1 AI = 60fps stable
