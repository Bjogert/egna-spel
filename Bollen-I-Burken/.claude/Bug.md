# ?? Bug Report: ResourceManager Constructor Missing After Refactor

**KISS Reminder**  
Keep the fix targeted and simple; do not reintroduce the old enterprise scaffold.

## Context
- Project: Dunkg√∂mme (Three.js ECS prototype)
- Recent Work: Stage 5 refactor moved networking and ResourceManager logic into smaller modules (`js/systems/network/`, `js/managers/resource/`).
