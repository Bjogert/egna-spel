## General Development Guidelines

### Professional Architecture Standards
- **Build for scalability from day one** - Design systems that can grow and expand
- **Enterprise-level code structure** - Use industry best practices and patterns
- **Modular design principles** - Separate concerns for maintainability and testing
- **Clean code standards** - Readable, documented, and self-explaining code
- **SOLID principles** - Single responsibility, open/closed, dependency inversion
- **Design patterns** - Use proven patterns (MVC, Observer, Factory, etc.)
- **Future-proof architecture** - Build foundations that support feature expansion

### Scalability Requirements
- **Component-based architecture** - Reusable, composable game components
- **Event-driven systems** - Loose coupling between game systems
- **Data-driven design** - Configuration over hard-coded values
- **Performance optimization** - Built-in profiling and optimization hooks
- **Memory management** - Object pooling and efficient resource handling
- **Extensible plugin system** - Easy addition of new features and mechanics

## Technical Requirements

### Core Technologies
- **HTML5** - Structure and Canvas/WebGL for game rendering
- **CSS3** - Styling, animations, and responsive design
- **JavaScript** - Game logic, controls, and interactivity
- **Three.js** - 3D graphics and WebGL abstraction
- **Canvas API** - 2D graphics rendering
- **Web Audio API** - Sound effects and music

### Browser Compatibility
